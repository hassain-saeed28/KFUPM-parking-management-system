# KFUPM-parking-management-system
This is my course project for ics-104 which is a course that teaches python.
the purpose of the project is to organize the parking system in KFUPM by allowing the users to register also check in, check out, view the parking buildings, and view all the information in a formatted way in three files the first one is registered vehicles the second is parked vehicles and the third one is buildings file.
